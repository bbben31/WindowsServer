<!-- BEGIN GENERATED COMPLETION CONTRACT -->
## Self-learner completion contract

Generated from `metadata/curriculum-source.json`; edit that entry and regenerate rather than editing this section.

**Prerequisites (in order):** Instructions/General/Learner-Setup.md; Instructions/General/Environment-Profiles.md; Instructions/General/Member-Servers-and-Clients.md; Instructions/Practices/Create-a-Log-Analytics-Workspace.md; Instructions/Practices/Add-server-to-Azure-Arc.md; Instructions/Practices/Create-an-Automation-account.md. Provision only existing prerequisite machines and their required roles, disks, certificates and test data before starting; create phase-created machines in the designated tasks. Preserve the selected profile and recorded VMnet mapping. Take a coordinated pre-lab recovery point for every guest changed by this exercise; do not independently rewind a domain controller.

**Machines and network profile:** VN1-SRV1 (VMware display: VN1-SRV1; accepted display aliases: WIN-VN1-SRV1; existing); VN1-SRV8 (VMware display: VN1-SRV8; accepted display aliases: WIN-VN1-SRV8; existing). Enterprise expansion: named source VNet1/VNet2/VNet3 and 10.1.x.0/24 segments use distinct isolated VMware custom VMnets. Record the per-exercise mapping; disable VMware DHCP on Windows DHCP segments. Temporary outbound VMnet8 NAT during the declared online or media-staging steps only; disconnect afterward.

**Permissions:** Local Administrator on the named disposable guests for role, service, storage, registry and remote-management changes; authorized lab account for remote access. Scoped Arc, Policy, Monitor and Update Manager permissions required by the selected task

**Outbound access:** Temporary VMware NAT VMnet8; preserve AD DNS on the lab NIC, disable NAT NIC DNS registration, remove outbound connectivity afterward. Endpoints: login.microsoftonline.com; management.azure.com; Service-specific endpoints in the linked Microsoft product requirements.

**Risk, cost and optional status:** high; cost-gated; optional=false. Estimate current service charges before deployment; stop at the GBP 10 monthly safety limit. Confirm deletion and billing after completion. Enterprise expansion profile; retain the named multi-server roles and isolate all source networks in VMware.

**Success verification:** Arc agent connection, monitored data and assigned lab policy/update results are visible in the approved scope.

**Rollback and cleanup:** Delete only resources created for this exercise in the disposable resource group; remove exercise-specific assignments, agents/registrations and identities after checking dependencies. Verify the group is empty, no schedules remain and no recurring charges continue. Retain required prerequisite resources until dependent exercises finish. Disconnect temporary VMnet8 and restore recorded guest DNS/adapters.

> **Learner topology note:** Complete [Learner setup](../General/Learner-Setup.md) and the practices linked below first. Provision only existing prerequisite machines, disks, cluster roles and certificates before starting; create machines marked Created during exercise in their designated tasks. Follow alternatives and conditional-retirement requirements instead of starting every named VM; the foundation machines alone may not be enough. Use your own documented addresses and the ad.lab.test domain. Do not use classroom provisioning scripts or credentials.



> **Azure safety:** This lab can create or modify Azure resources. Use only your own subscription and tenant, substitute <AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>, <AZURE_TENANT_ID>, <AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP>, and <AZURE_REGION>, apply least privilege and a budget, and remove disposable resources afterward.




## Required VMs

* VN1-SRV1
* VN1-SRV8

## Setup

Use your existing tenant, Azure for Students subscription, disposable `<AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP>`, and UK South where supported. Verify current Azure Arc provider, policy, monitoring, update-management, role, quota, and cost requirements before starting.

You need to complete the practices before starting with the lab.

1. [Create a Log Analytics Workspace](../Practices/Create-a-Log-Analytics-Workspace.md)
1. [Add server to Azure Arc](../Practices/Add-server-to-Azure-Arc.md)

## Introduction

To increase manageability and security of servers, Adatum wants to add on-premises servers as Azure resources using Azure Arc. Policies should be implemented to monitor configuration glitches. Data should be collected from the connected servers for further analysis in the Azure Portal. Moreover, Adatum wants to manage the on-premises server using Windows Admin Center without an on-premises Windows Admin Center installation. Finally, Adatum wants to manage updates for servers using the Azure Portal and ensure, the servers are up-to-date.

## Known issues

Policy assignment requires appropriate authorization at the selected scope. If the current account lacks it, assign the narrowest documented Azure Policy role temporarily, wait for role propagation, and remove the assignment during cleanup. Do not broaden directory roles to solve a subscription-scope permission error.

## Exercises

## Exercise 1: Working with policies

1. [Assign recommended policies](#task-1-assign-recommended-policies) to VN1-SRV8
1. [Create a policy assignment to identify non-compliant resources](#task-2-create-a-policy-assignment-to-identify-non-compliant-resources)
1. [Monitor compliance](#task-3-monitor-compliance)

    > What is the state of the policy Audit Windows VMs with a pending reboot and why?

    > What is the state of the policy Audit Windows machines that contain certificate expiring within the specified number of days and why?

    > What is the state of the policy Windows machines should have Log Analytics agent installed on Azure Arc and why?

### Task 1: Assign recommended policies

### Task 2: Create a policy assignment to identify non-compliant resources

Perform this task on the host computer.

1. Open **Microsoft Edge** and navigate to <https://portal.azure.com>
1. Sign in to Azure.
1. In **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)**, type **Policy** and click it.
1. In Policy, under **Authoring**, click **Assignments**.

    > The policy Audit Windows VMs with a pending reboot will have the state Non-Compliant with a resource compliance of 0 out of 1, because VN1-SRV8 should not have a pending reboot.

    > The policy Audit Windows machines that contain certificate expiring within the specified number of days will have the state Non-Compliant with a resource compliance of 0 out of 1, because VN1-SRV8 should not have expiring certificates.

    > The policy \[Preview\]: Log Analytics extension should be installed on your Windows Azure Arc machines will have the state Non-Compliant with a resource compliance of 0 out of 1, because VN1-SRV8 does not have an agent installed yet. You will fix that in an upcoming exercise.

    You may want to click one or the other of the policy to review details.

## Exercise 2: Using Windows Admin Center in the Azure Portal

> **Eligibility gate:** Verify the current [Windows Server management entitlement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/windows-server-management-overview) for the Arc-enabled VN1-SRV8 before installing this optional extension. Attest Software Assurance/subscription coverage only when the recorded machine license actually qualifies.
