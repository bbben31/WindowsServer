# Lab: Configure high availability for Remote Desktop Services

> **Learner topology note:** Complete [Learner setup](../General/Learner-Setup.md) and the practices linked below first. Provision every VM, extra disk, cluster member, certificate, and client named by this lab; the foundation machines alone may not be enough. Use your own documented addresses and the ad.lab.testd.lab.test domain. Do not use classroom provisioning scripts or credentials.



> **Azure safety:** This lab can create or modify Azure resources. Use only your own subscription and tenant, substitute <AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>, <AZURE_TENANT_ID>, <AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP>, and <AZURE_REGION>, apply least privilege and a budget, and remove disposable resources afterward.

## Introduction

To ensure business continuity of Remote Desktop Services, you want to configure high availability of licensing, RD Web Access, RD Gateway, and RD Connection Broker.

## Exercises

1. [Configure high availability for licensing](#exercise-1-configure-high-availbility-for-licensing)
1. [Configure high availability for RD Web Access](#exercise-2-configure-high-availbility-for-rd-web-access)
1. [Configure high availability for RD Gateway](#exercise-3-configure-high-availability-for-rd-gateway)
1. [Configure high availability for RD Connection Broker](#exercise-4-configure-high-availability-for-rd-connection-broker)

1. In Remote Desktop Services > Overview, under DEPLOYMENT OVERVIEW, click **TASKS**, **Edit Deployment Properties**.
1. In Deployment Properties, click the page **RD Licensing**.
1. On page RD Licensing, click **Per User**. Here, you could change the order of licensing server to which license requests are sent.
1. Click **OK**.

## Exercise 2: Configure high availbility for RD Web Access

1. [Add RD Web Access server](#task-1-add-rd-web-access-server) PM-SRV4
1. [Install the certificate for RD Web Access](#task-2-install-the-certificate-for-rd-web-access) again
1. [Add a DNS Record](#task-3-add-a-dns-record) for remote.lab.test pointing to 10.1.200.32 (PM-SRV4)

*Note*: In real world, instead of creating a DNS round-robin configuration, you would configure a load balancer in front of the RD Web Access servers.

### Task 1: Add RD Web Access Server

Perform these steps on CL1.

1. Open **Server Manager**.
1. In Server Manager, click **Remote Desktop Services**.
1. In Remote Desktop Services > Overview, under DEPLOYMENT SERVERS, click **TASKS**, **Add RD Web Access Servers**.
1. In Add RD Web Access Servers, under Server Pool, click **PM-SRV4.ad.lab.test**, click the arrow button between the columns and click **Next >**.
