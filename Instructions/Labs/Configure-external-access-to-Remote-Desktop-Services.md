# Lab: Configure external access to Remote Desktop Services

> **Learner topology note:** Complete [Learner setup](../General/Learner-Setup.md) and the practices linked below first. Provision every VM, extra disk, cluster member, certificate, and client named by this lab; the foundation machines alone may not be enough. Use your own documented addresses and the ad.lab.testd.lab.test domain. Do not use classroom provisioning scripts or credentials.




## Required VMs

* VN1-SRV1
* VN1-SRV8
* VN1-SRV9
* VN1-SRV10
* VN2-SRV1
* PM-SRV3
* CL1
