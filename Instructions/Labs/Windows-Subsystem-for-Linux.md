# Lab: Windows Subsystem for Linux

> **Learner topology note:** Complete [Learner setup](../General/Learner-Setup.md) and the practices linked below first. Provision every VM, extra disk, cluster member, certificate, and client named by this lab; the foundation machines alone may not be enough. Use your own documented addresses and the ad.lab.testd.lab.test domain. Do not use classroom provisioning scripts or credentials.




## Required VMs

* A domain controller (VN1-SRV5 or VN1-SRV1)
* VN1-SRV9

## Introduction

Your developers maintain a server application that consists of components running under Windows and Linux. For easier development, you want to provide them with a machine that can run all components on a single system. Therefore, you want to evaluate Windows Subsystem for Linux.

First, you will install WSL with a distribution. Then, you want to find out how networking works and how to access files in the Linux distribution from Windows.

At the end of your evaluation, you want to uninstall the Linux distribution and WSL.

## Exercises

1. [Install Windows Subsystem for Linux](#exercise-1-install-windows-subsystem-for-linux)
1. [Work with Windows Subsystem for Linux](#exercise-2-work-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux)
1. [Uninstall Windows Subsystem for Linux](#exercise-3-uninstall-windows-subsystem-for-linux)

## Exercise 1: Install Windows Subsystem for Linux

1. [Configure nested virtualization](#task-1-configure-nested-virtualization) for VN1-SRV9
1. [Install Windows Subsystem for Linux](#task-2-install-windows-subsystem-for-linux) without a distribution
1. [Install and configure a distribution](#task-3-install-and-configure-a-distribution)

### Task 1: Configure nested virtualization

Perform this task on the host.

1. Open **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.
1. In Windows PowerShell (Admin), for **WIN-VN1-SRV9**, shut down the virtual machine, expose the virtualization extensions to the virtual machine, enable MAC address spoofing, disable dynamic memory and set the startup memory to **3 GB**, and start the virtual machine again.

    ````powershell
    $vMName = 'WIN-VN1-SRV9'
    Stop-VM -VMName $vMName
    Set-VMProcessor -VMName $vMName -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true
    
    Get-VMNetworkAdapter -VMName $vMName |
    Set-VMNetworkAdapter -MacAddressSpoofing On

    Set-VM -VMName $vMName -StaticMemory -MemoryStartupBytes 3GB
    Start-VM -VMName $vMName
    ````

### Task 2: Install Windows Subsystem for Linux

Perform this task on VN1-SRV9.

1. Sign in as **ad\Administrator**.
1. Open **Terminal**.
1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux without a distribution.

    ````powershell
    wsl --install --no-distribution
    ````

1. Restart the computer.

    ````powershell
    Restart-Computer
    ````

### Task 3: Install and configure a distribution

Perform this task on VN1-SRV9.

1. Sign in as **ad\Administrator**.
1. Open **Terminal**.
1. List the available distributions.

    ````powershell
    wsl --list --online
    ````

1. Install the latest version of Ubuntu. If you are more familiar with another distribution, feel free to install your favorite distribution.

    ````powershell
    wsl --install --distribution Ubuntu
    ````

    Wait for the download and installation to complete. This will take a few minutes.

1. List installed Linux distributions.

    ````powershell
    wsl --list --verbose
    ````

1. Launch Ubuntu.

    ````powershell
    wsl --distribution Ubuntu
    ````

1. At the prompt Create a default Unix user account, type a name for your account, e.g. your first name, and take a note.
1. At the prompts New password and Retype new password, type a secure password and take a note.

If time allows, you can install additional distributions. This will take less time than the first one.

1. Log out of Linux.

    ````bash
    logout
    ````

1. Close **Terminal**.

## Exercise 2: Work with Windows Subsystem for Linux

1. [Find out the IP addresses](#task-1-find-out-the-ip-addresses) of the Linux distribution from Windows and of the Windows Host from Linux
1. [Access files in Linux](#task-2-access-files-in-linux) home directory from Windows
1. [Update the Linux distribution](#task-3-update-the-linux-distribution)
1. [Install a graphical Linux application](#task-4-install-a-graphical-linux-application), e.g. quadrapassel

1. Open **Terminal**.
1. In Terminal, run the command ```hostname -I``` in the Linux distribution.

    ````powershell
    wsl --distribution Ubuntu hostname -I
    ````

    The displayed IP address is the IP address of the Linux distribution.

1. In Terminal, click the down chevron and click **Ubuntu**.
1. On the tab Ubuntu, find out the IP address of the Windows host.

    ````bash
    ip route show | grep -i default | awk '{ print $3}'
    ````

    The displayed IP address is the IP address of the Windows host.
