**Prerequisites (in order):** Instructions/General/Learner-Setup.md; Instructions/General/Environment-Profiles.md; Instructions/General/Member-Servers-and-Clients.md; Instructions/Practices/Request-and-export-certificates-for-the-connection-broker-and-RD-web.md. Provision the declared roles, disks, certificates and test data before the first task; preserve the selected profile and recorded VMnet mapping. Take a coordinated pre-lab recovery point for every guest changed by this exercise; do not independently rewind a domain controller.

**Machines and network profile:** CL1 (VMware display: CL1; accepted display aliases: WIN-CL1; existing); PM-SRV3 (VMware display: PM-SRV3; accepted display aliases: WIN-PM-SRV3; existing); VN1-SRV1 (VMware display: VN1-SRV1; accepted display aliases: WIN-VN1-SRV1; existing); VN1-SRV10 (VMware display: VN1-SRV10; accepted display aliases: WIN-VN1-SRV10; existing); VN1-SRV8 (VMware display: VN1-SRV8; accepted display aliases: WIN-VN1-SRV8; existing); VN1-SRV9 (VMware display: VN1-SRV9; accepted display aliases: WIN-VN1-SRV9; existing); VN2-SRV1 (VMware display: VN2-SRV1; accepted display aliases: WIN-VN2-SRV1; existing). Core foundation: VMnet10 10.10.10.0/24 (AD), VMnet20 10.10.20.0/24 (workloads), VMnet30 10.10.30.0/24 (clients); use only the NICs required by this procedure.

**Permissions:** Local Administrator on the named disposable guests for role, service, storage, registry and remote-management changes; authorized lab account for remote access.

**Outbound access:** Isolated lab; no online download is required by the selected procedure.

**Risk, cost and optional status:** high; local-only; optional=false. Core learner profile unless the procedure declares an additional enterprise role or compatibility gate.

**Success verification:** The intended deployment roles, collection and certificates are registered; an authorized client starts a test session.

**Rollback and cleanup:** Restore the coordinated pre-lab recovery points of affected disposable guests and remove only exercise-created data/configuration. Retain prerequisite roles until dependent exercises finish; restore recorded adapters/DNS/settings.

> **Learner topology note:** Complete [Learner setup](../General/Learner-Setup.md) and the practices linked below first. Provision every VM, extra disk, cluster member, certificate, and client named by this lab; the foundation machines alone may not be enough. Use your own documented addresses and the ad.lab.test domain. Do not use classroom provisioning scripts or credentials.

## Introduction

Your company wants to create a full Remote Desktop Services session deployment. For the first tests, you want to implement a simple deployment consisting of one connection broker server, three session host servers, one RD web server and one RD licensing server. Moreover, you want to test the load balancing and reconnection of users between session hosts.
